### Who am I?

Hola, my name is Nick, a 20 year old student from Ghana, studying in the state of Washington! I started this blog to document my programming journey, fun little side projects I make along the way, and whatever interesting stuff happens in my life, which you can find in the <a>French Blog</a> section (mon fran√ßais est un peu rudimentaire. Soyez gentil ,svp, les francophones. :)). 

### Interests

 - I love making cool projects! From AI to simulations I tend to lose track of time discovering new compilations errors.  My favorite projects so far, have been a sketch classifier and an awesome super duper optimized n-body simulation using quad trees and z-order curves!


- Games! Board games or video games I love em all. My **REDACTED** hours of play time in Factorio and RimWorld says enough. I'm also a fan of grand strategy games like CK2, and Stellaris. If i need a little mental break, I don't mind a little bit of Elder Scrolls.


- Afrobeats enters my soul and allows me to discover muscles I did not know existed. Asake and BurnaBoy are the GOATs. My favorite album has to be [Love Damini - Burna Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3rOq9lYjeQ&list=PL_Sc3Kp_QmNYyjuRSZ9q5nbdYdQ39VTZb). My favorite song from the album [It's Plenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8bZVnynDdc&list=PL_Sc3Kp_QmNYyjuRSZ9q5nbdYdQ39VTZb&index=9) is just euphoric!. My other favorite songs has got to be [Lonely At The Top - Asake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JQA7W_dLUg&list=RD3JQA7W_dLUg&start_radio=1) and [Terminator - King Promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPCC02SaJVg&list=RDNPCC02SaJVg&start_radio=1) 
- To keep it brief my other interests, are working out and tennis. I am also addicted to jump roping and enjoy reading!

### The end?

That's about it! Well not really, you can learn more me and my projects in the other posts. Thanks for reading!

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

Hola, my name is Nick, a 20 year old student from Ghana, studying in the state of Washington! I started this blog to document my programming journey, fun little side projects I make along the way, and whatever interesting stuff happens in my life, which you can find in the <a>French Blog</a> section (mon fran√ßais est un peu rudimentaire. Soyez gentil ,svp, les francophones. :)). 

<h3>Interests</h3>

 - I love making cool projects! From AI to simulations I tend to lose track of time discovering new compilations errors.  My favorite projects so far, have been a sketch classifier and an awesome super duper optimized n-body simulation using quad trees and z-order curves!


- Games! Board games or video games I love em all. My **REDACTED** hours of play time in Factorio and RimWorld says enough. I'm also a fan of grand strategy games like CK2, and Stellaris. If i need a little mental break, I don't mind a little bit of Elder Scrolls.


- Afrobeats enters my soul and allows me to discover muscles I did not know existed. Asake and BurnaBoy are the GOATs. My favorite album has to be <a href = "">Love Damini - Burna Boy</a>. My favorite song from the album <a> It's Plenty</a> is just euphoric!. My other favorite songs has got to be <a> Lonely At The Top -Asake </a> and <a> Terminator - King Promise</a>
- To keep it brief my other interests, are working out and tennis. I am also addicted to jump roping and enjoy reading!

	<h3>The end?</h3>
That's about it! Well not really, you can learn more me and my projects in the other posts. Thanks for reading! <a href="/hugo-theme-terminal-demo/posts/showcase-code/">code showcase</a>
